# deep-learning-challenge
Homework 21
Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose for this analysis was to predict if a person would be successful if they where funded by Alphabet Soup.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? 
The target was IS_SUCCESSFUL.

What variable(s) are the features for your model? 
Features included were 

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
I chose 8 neurons, 2 layers, and relu and sigmoid as my activation functions. I thought this would be a good base to start at.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance? 
No. 60% was my highest accuracy score.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
I increased the number of neurons, dropped status column and changed around the activation functions.

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.

I believe a linear regression model may have worked better for this dataset, and it would make it more explainable.
